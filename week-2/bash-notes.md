#### Bash commands

```bash
$ ls  #list directory contents

$ cat #concatenate files and print on the standard output

$ cd #change the working directory

$ cat -- -file* #The double dash -- is used to tell the command that the subsequent arguments are file names, not   options. This is necessary because filenames that start with a hyphen can sometimes be interpreted as command options.

$ find  #search for files in a directory hierarchy

$ grep #print lines that match patterns
```
